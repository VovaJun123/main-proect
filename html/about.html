                            About Us
                        </h3>
                        <p class="about-parahraf">In 2007 the well-known Building Company SB Construction recognised the
                            need to establish a high
                            quality and reliable joinery service to take project management and client service within
                            the
                            construction sector to the next level.

                            ​

                            Having a workshop dedicated to the manufacture of our own products gave us more control over
                            a
                            project time line. We were no longer subject to unforeseen delays posed by using external
                            carpentry and joinery services. We could avoid hold ups to the works dependent on those
                            products
                            being manufactured and progress as a whole on larger projects.

                            ​

                            Our new arm of the business also allowed us to provide more quality assurance to our
                            customers.
                            We put together a team of the most skilled craftsmen who demonstrated impeccable workmanship
                            in
                            CNC milling, hand joinery, spray painting, finishing and veneering services. The products
                            coming
                            out of our workshop were guaranteed to be as beautifully crafted, luxurious and unique as
                            the
                            high end construction business required.

                            ​

                            The success of our workshop and the quality of joinery it produced quickly lead to
                            expansion. In
                            response to a demand for its products, SBCJ was soon offering services to other construction
                            firms, culminating in SBCJ becoming a limited company in 2012.

                            ​

                            In 2019 we located to new, larger premises and invested in the latest CNC machinery and
                            design
                            technology. The purchase of this equipment has further improved both our products and our
                            service.



                            We can create more unique and imaginative designs. We have more ways at our finger tips to
                            display the possibilities to clients. We can deliver improved lead times and competitive
                            prices
                            on our projects and we can promise high quality products with immaculate finishes to all our
                            clients.

                            ​

                            The SBCJ team has the capacity to engage in projects both small and large scale, fabricate
                            both
                            bespoke items and bulk orders. This allows us to work directly with a home owner in search
                            of
                            something special, or in collaboration with architects and builders on a grand design.

                            ​

                            The key to our business success has been the pride we take in our craft and the enjoyment
                            our
                            clients take in our creations.</p>
